  Revoke a Token (Self).
  This command attempts to revoke the token set to the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable against the Vault instance set to the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable. These environment variables are assumed to be already set by the `auth-oidc` command in the previous steps. When the token is revoked, all dynamic secrets generated with it are also revoked.
steps:
  - run:
      when: always
      name: Revoke Vault token
      command: |
        if [ ! "$(which vault)" ]; then
            echo "vault is not installed. Please use install command first."
            exit 1
        fi

        vault token revoke -self
